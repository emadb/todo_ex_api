# TodoApi: a simple kata for learning how to create an API in Elixir

To run the test you need to install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and start the docker compose to boot the database (postegresql).  
Then run `mix deps.get` from the terminal to install all the needed dependencies.  
Finally you can run the tests using `mix test`. All test should be green!  
The tests are all in the `ping_test.ex` file.  

Happy coding!
